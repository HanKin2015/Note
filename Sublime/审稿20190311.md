Paper title: <<Deep Heterogeneous Social Network Alignment>>

Paper theme:
In this paper, the authors propose to address the heterogeneous social network alignment problem with a deep learning model, namely DETA (Deep nETwork Alignment). Besides a small number of explicit features, DETA can automatically learn a set of latent features from the heterogeneous information. DETA models the anchor link one-to-one cardinality constraint as a mathematical constraint on the node degrees. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world aligned heterogeneous social network datasets, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model compared against the existing state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Weak points:
W1:  
W2: There is a problem with the above typesetting in section 4 of the page 7.
W3: The DETA doesn't rank first in every measurement, the results aren't very stable.
W4: The case study is not clear and too much perfunctory.
