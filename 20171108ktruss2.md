# ABSTRACT
- given a query vertex q in G, to find as outputall the densely connected subgraphs of G, each of whichcontains the query v. 

- community detection problem, community search.

- In this paper, we study the community searchproblem in the truss-based model aimed at discovering alldense and cohesive k-truss communities to which the query vertex q belongs.

- Consequently,all the edges of G can be partitioned to a series of k-truss equivalence classes that constitute a space-ecient, trusspreserving index structure, EquiTruss. 

- TCP-Index.

# 1. INTRODUCTION
- Given a graph G, a k-truss (k >= 2) is the largest subgraph of G with each constituent edge contained in at least (k - 2) triangles.

- modelling real-world community structures, including clique or quasiclique, k-core , k-truss , and nucleus , to name a few.

## 1.1 choice of k-truss by the following important facts
- (1) as opposed to primitive vertices/edges, the higher-order graph motif, triangle, is exploited as building blocks to quantify the strong and stable relationships in communities .
As a result, the high-density and cohesiveness of real-world
communities can be encoded in k-truss with strong theoretical
guarantees (more details will be elaborated in Section
2.2); 
- (2) k-truss enables a comprehensive modelling of
multiple, overlapping communities in G. By tuning the parameter
k, we can derive a collection of k-truss communities
that form an inclusive, dense-graph hierarchy representing
the cores of G at varied levels of granularity [26];
-  (3) discovering
all k-trusses from G is polynomially tractable [33],
while most existing dense-graph models render the community
search problem NP-hard [13, 6]. As a consequence, ktruss
has been extensively employed for community search in real-world networked applications [12, 14, 13, 11, 33].

## 1.2 the concept of k-truss equivalence
 given two edges e and e0 of G, they are k-truss equivalent if and only if they belong to the same k-truss, and are further connected by a series of triangles in a strong sense (modeled by the notion of k-triangle connectivity in Definition 9).

# 2. BACKGROUND
## 2.1 Preliminaries
### Definition 1 - Edge Support(支持度)
denote:sup(e) = k
支持度等于以这条边组成的三角形个数，边中间没有节点。

### Definition 2 - Subgraph Trussness
denote:$\tau(G') = k$
在一个k-子图中每条边的支持度大于等于k-2.

### Definition 3 - Triangle Adjacency
denote:${\Delta_1 \bigcap  \Delta_2} \neq {\phi} $
两个三角形有公共边,针对于两个三角形。

### Definition 4 - Triangle Connectivity
denote:$\Delta_s \leftrightarrow \Delta_t$

这个概念相对于定义3差不多，只是补充说明了如果两个三角形是连接的，但不一定是邻接的，只要中间存在一系列的三角形进行传递，则两个三角形中的任意边可表示为$e \leftrightarrow e'$.
Consider two triangles s and t in G. They are connected, denoted as $e \leftrightarrow e'$.

1. 这两条边在同一个三角形里面
2. 两个三角形是连接的，则这任意两条边是连接的。$e \leftrightarrow e'$.

They are connected, denoted as $\Delta_s \leftrightarrow \Delta_t$, if there exist a sequence of n triangles $\Delta_1, ..., \Delta_n$ in G (n >= 2), such that $\Delta_1 = \Delta_s, \Delta_n = \Delta_t,$ and for 1 <=  i < n, $\Delta_i \bigcap  \Delta_{i + 1} \neq \phi $.

翻译过来，这里存在一系列的n个三角形，相邻的两个三角形拥有共享边。

### Definition 5 - k-truss Community
1. G' is a k-truss
2. $\forall e,e' \in E_{G'}, e \leftrightarrow e'$

### Definition 6 - k-truss community search
find all k-truss communities containing query vertex q.

## 2.2 Related Work
### Community search
### Truss
k-core (each vertex in a k-core has its degree no less than k)

Truss is defined on the higher-order graph motif, triangle, and enjoys numerous advantages in community modelling and computation : a k-truss is a (k - 1)-core but not vice versa; a k-truss is (k - 1)-edge-connected: any deletion of fewer than (k - 1) edges will not disconnect a k-truss; a ktruss with n vertices has its diameter no more than $\left \lfloor {\frac{2n - 2}{k}} \right \rfloor$; that is, a k-truss is diameter-bounded.

 An improved algorithm was further proposed based on triangle enumeration in O(|EG|^{3/2}) time . A similar I/O-ecient algorithm for k-truss computation was designed and facilitated by graph database technologies . A parallel method, PETA, can detect local k-trusses within a few iterations, and it has the same complexity as corresponding serial algorithms .

# 3. TRUSS EQUIVALENCE
### Definition 7 - Edge Trussness
denote:$\tau(e) = k$

truss = 支持度 + 2

其实这个我一直认为就是边的支持度。但不能这样认为，这条边的truss值等于边在最大子图中的k-truss中的k值。也就是说
is the maximum subgraph trussness of a subgraph $G* \in G$ that involves e as a constituent edge, i.e., $\tau (e) = maxG \subseteq  G{\tau (G*) : e \in E_{G *}}.$

compute edge supports in O(|E|^1.5)

The time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(|EG| ^1.5) and its space complexity is O(|VG| + |EG|) .

### Definition 8 - k-triangle
三角形中最小的边的truss大于等于k。

### Definition 9 - k-triangle connectivity
跟定义8相近。no, no, no。连接是中间可以有一系列的三角形。相邻的三角形的有公共边，并且公共边的truss值为k。强调公共边不能超过k，否则也不算k-triangle connectivity。

### Definition 10 - k-truss equivalence
所有边的truss等于k。

Theorem 1. k-truss equivalence is an equivalence relation upon EG.

# 4. TRUSS-EQUIVALENCE BASED INDEX
## 4.1 Index Design and Construction
a graph-structured index, EquiTruss. EquiTruss allows incremental update when G changes dynamically.

- super-node
- super-edge

processed is a Boolean variable indicating whether e has been examined in index construction, and is initialized to FALSE (Line 3); list is a set of super-node identifies, each of which represents a previously explored super-node, µ, where ⌧ (µ) < k, and µ is triangle-connected to the current super-node, ⌫ (⌧ (⌫) = k), via the edge e. The e.list is initialized as an empty set (Line 4).

Theorem 2. EquiTruss can be constructed in O(|EG|^1.5) time and O(|EG|) space by Algorithm 2.
